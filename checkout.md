# About this textbook

## Content

- targetted to a specific text or corpus
- covers only features of language found in the target texts


## Organization

Organized in modules comprising:

- introduction of grammatical topics
- minimally modified passages from the target corpus
- interactive exercises and drills
- "making connections": relating topics in this module to our lives today

## Sequence of grammtical topics

Topics sequenced by: 

- prominence in target corpus
- unfamiliarity to English speakers
- complexity of the topic 
- priority to topics enabling students to explore continuous, contextualized reading, rather than isolated sentences

> -> **teach to the synopsis, not the paradigm**

## Vocabulary

First half of course: emphasis on a small core vocabulary (perhaps < 200 words).  This vocabulary is defined by comparison with other Greek corpora, and finding shared items in the highest frequency lists of individual corpora (rather than the common practice of finding most frequent terms in a *composite* list:  this effaces the differences in vocabulary from one corpus to another).

It includes:

- function words (prepositions, particles, conjunctions)
- the article and pronouns
- a small core of extremely common verbs, especially those which have a large number of compounds.  In counting the frequency of a simplex verb like φέρω, we include occurrences of compounds such as ἐπιφέρω or ἐκφέρω.

It includes a relatively small number of nouns, and fewer adjectives:  these parts of speech vary more from one corpus to another.


In the second half of the course, we focus on a second vocabulary tier:  terms that are frequent in the target corpus and related or similar texts, but not necessarily in other Greek corpora.  The goal is to have a large enough vocabulary to recognize 75-90% of the lexical items in the target text, excluding proper nouns and adjectives.  For some target texts, a vocabulary of < 500 words may be adequate.  This second vocabulary tier will include more verbs, a larger number of nouns, and some additional adjectives.








# Module 1: Greek verbs


## Language

Summary of what we cover:

# Exercises



- drills identifying verb forms?
- drills on principal parts?
- drills on singular<->plural?
- drills on imperfect<->aorist?
- drills changing voice?


# Module 1: summary of forms and grammar

- form the imperfect indicative in all three voices on the *first principal part*
- form the aorist indicative 
    - *active and middle* on the *third* principal part
    - *passive* on the *sixth* principal part


Imperfect: first principal part: ends in -*ω* -*νυμι*

Aorist: act.mid:  
    - "first" aorist: ends in -*α*
    - "second" aorist: ends in -*ον*

## Paradigms

The aorist indicative in the third person.  (Forms highlighted `like this` are not required to be memorized in module 1.)

# Language

Main areas of focus are:
- first subordinate clause (introducing subordinating conjunctions, use of μή)
- sequence of tenses
- morphology of subjunctive and optative moods, all three voices, 3S and Pl (aorist, imperfect tenses)

# Making Connections 

- Phuc Tran on the power of a non-indicative mood

# Exercises, Reading, and Composition

- Continuing with Lysias 1, sections 20-22(?)
- Can express purpose in two different ways


# Module 4: assignments


# Module 4: making connections

- Watch Phuc Tran's TED Talk, "The Dark Side of the Subjunctive." 

  Our discussion of Tran's talk will examine the power of verbal moods (other than the indicative), and how they expand the universe of ideas we can describe.


# Exercises

- drills on indentifying verb forms of subjunctives/optatives
- drills on creating verb forms of subjunctives/optatives
- drills on translating purposes clauses
- drills on composing purpose clauses, running through various parts of sequence of tenses


# Module 4: Subordination, the Subjunctive and Optative Moods

In this module, we will introduce the first of several types of subordinate clauses you will learn in Greek: the purpose clause. 

You will see that the purpose clause (a subordinate clause, introduced by a subordinating conjunction with a verb in the subjunctive or optative) is an alternative method of expressing the idea of purpose through a future tense participle. Options!

This subordinate clause features finite verbs of the subjunctive or optative mood.
